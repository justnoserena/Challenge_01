# **Accessibility Challenge**
---
The goal in completing this challenge was to edit the code to adhere to a format that 
is used by real-world web developers while making sure the webpage met acceptance criteria. 
The criteria given from Trilogy Education Services, is as follows:

"GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order"
